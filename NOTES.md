TODO: 1) Change all '/:id' routes into slug routes
2) Make it so input values can use ',' Right now if I type 35,000 into the 'miles' portion it saves as 35
3) Validate users 
4) Make records persist and be linkable. i.e. if you click on oil change it will list the current maintenance but below it are a record of past maintenances performed and the date performed (need to add a date input on the forms and add a column through a migration of the db)
